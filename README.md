# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Rachel Rub in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. 
Clearly awknowedged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. 
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester of in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. 
I awknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course. 

# Project Description
The first private prison in the U.S. came into existance in 1984. Since then, the number of private prisons and people incarcerated in private prisons has increased dramatically. There have been many studies on the quality of private prisons over public prisons, typically looking at internal variables such as financing, security and opperations. There is a lot of controversy regarding the ethics of private prisons, as well as their quality. However, there has been less exploration of the broad, macro-level trends of private prisons, specifically in relation to all prisons and politics.

In this project, I will analyze the change in people incarcerated in private prisons over time and people, relative to the change in total people incarcerate. Secondly, I will normalize the number data of people incarcerated by state relative to the population of that state. Finally I will look at where most private prisons are located and see if there is a relationship between the states in which private prisons are concentrated and that state's political leaning.

The data behind this project comes from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, (JBS), for information on incarceration rates, number of private prisons, and location of private prisons; Pew Research Center for information about party affiliation by state.

I will download the data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics from their website into an excel sheet. I will do the same for Pew Research Center.
